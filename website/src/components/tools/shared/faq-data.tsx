          PDF merging is the process of combining multiple separate PDF files

            <strong>Upload your files:</strong> Drag and drop your PDFs into the

            <strong>Metadata:</strong> The new document is created with blank
            metadata fields (like Title, Author, etc.). This gives you a clean
            slate for the combined file.

    question: 'What is PDF metadata?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          PDF metadata is &quot;data about data.&quot; It&apos;s a set of
          information hidden within the PDF file that describes the
          document&apos;s properties. This information isn&apos;t part of the
          visible content (like text or images) but helps software and people
          understand, organize, and search for the file.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Think of it like the information on the back of a book cover: it tells
          you the title, author, and publisher without you having to read the
          book itself.

    id: 'metadata-2',
    question: 'Why should I edit PDF metadata?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>Editing metadata is important for several reasons:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Professionalism:</strong> Ensure documents, like reports or
            CVs, correctly list you as the author and have a proper title.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> Search engines
            use metadata like the title and keywords to index and rank your PDF
            in search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organization:</strong> Proper metadata makes it much easier
            to search for and manage documents on your computer or in a document
            management system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Privacy:</strong> Remove personal or sensitive information
            (like the original author&apos;s name or software used) before
            sharing a document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance:</strong> Some archival standards or company
            policies require specific metadata to be present and accurate.

            <strong>Keywords:</strong> Comma-separated words to aid in
            searching.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creator:</strong> The original application used to create
            the document (e.g., &quot;Microsoft Word&quot;).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Producer:</strong> The application that converted the file

            <strong>Trapped:</strong> A technical field for professional
            printing. It indicates whether the file has been processed to

      <div>
        <p>
          The &quot;Trapped&quot; field is a technical property primarily used
          in the professional printing industry. It indicates whether the
          document has undergone a &quot;trapping&quot; process.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Trapping is a pre-press technique that creates tiny overlaps between
          adjacent colors to prevent visible gaps from appearing if the printing
          plates are slightly misaligned.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>For most users, this field can be ignored.</strong> You
          generally do not need to change it unless you have specific

    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          How metadata is displayed depends on your operating system and the
          software you use. Some file explorers (like Windows Explorer or macOS
          Finder) may not immediately refresh or display all PDF metadata
          fields.
